WELCOME TO THE TODO LIST SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION!


FEATURES:
    - Simple buttons
    - Local storage
    - Easy to use
    - Filtered lists

HOW TO USE:

    1. Navigate to the directory and run NPM start

    2. Once the app loads, there will be two options.
        - The left box will be for entries that include a "+" button to add tasks.
        - The right box is for filtering tasks (completed, incomplete, ALL).

    3. The two features for each task:
        1: The check mark next to each task is to mark them as "complete."
        2: The red trash can icon will remove the entry completely.

    4. When the page is refreshed, the tasks will still remain on the page as the
        entries are stored in the local storage.

    5. ENJOY!
